            Some new giberrish fresh off the press and straight into this page's hyper text media format thing
            whatever it's called it's great and I love it.

{
    "value": 5,
    "key": 8,
    "hello dude": "hi"
}

def very_cool_python_function(numbers: List(int)):
    for n in numbers:
        print(f"{n} is an amazing number"")

            This amazing beautiful fantastic cheetah looks out into the distance, searching for it's

            Or would it go vegeterian?
